# PKPy

PKPy is a small Python package to solve simple, compartment-based pharmacokinetic models. It currently supports bolus (one-time) or continuous drug administration and arbitrary numbers of peripheral compartments. Drug can be administered directly into a central compartment, or alternatively flow first into a special subcutaneous compartment and thence into the central one.

See the full documentation in the `docs/` directory.

# Installation
After cloning PKPy, you can use `pip` to install it:

`pip install /path/to/PKPy`

# Usage

## Specify your Model
Specify all parameters of the model to be solved in a JSON configuration file, with the following structure:

```json
{
    "basic_parameters" : {
        "subcutaneous" : 1,
        "dose" : [1000,"continuous"]
    },

    "compartment_1" : {
        "name" : "bloodstream",
        "type" : "central",
        "volume" : 600,
        "initial_amount" : 0.0,
        "rate_out": 1.0
    },

    "compartment_2" : {
        "name" : "subcutaneous",
        "type" : "subcutaneous",
        "volume" : 400,
        "initial_amount" : 0.0,
        "rate_out": 1.0
    },

    "compartment_3" : {
        "name" : "adipose",
        "type" : "peripheral",
        "volume" : 2000,
        "initial_amount" : 0.0,
        "rate_in" : 1.0,
        "rate_out": 1.0
    }
    ...
}
```

Compartment names may be freely chosen, but their type must be one of `"central"`, `"subcutaneous"` and `"peripheral"`. 
If a `"subcutaneous"`-type compartment is present, the boolean flag `"subcutaneous"` must be set to 1, otherwise it must be set to 0.

The `"dose"` parameter specifies the administration protocol. Specify a numeric dosage amount followed by one of `"continuous"` (for constant administration) or `"bolus"` (for one-time administration at time 0). Alternatively, specify a custom dosage protocol as an arbitraty lambda expression containing 'x' (the time variable). Refer to any `numpy` functions as `np.`.

See the `examples/` folder for inspiration.

## Usage from Python

After specifying the model parameters in a `json` configuration as described above, use the package from Python, like so:

```python
import PKPy as pk

model = pk.Model('/path/to/model_paramters.json')
solution_timeseries = model.solve()
model.plot()
```

This will generate a plot of individual compartment concentrations over time. Individual timeseries can then be accesessed as `solution_timeseries['compartment_name']` for further analysis.
